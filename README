Text-Capitalize
============================

Text::Capitalize provides functions to transform lines of text
into presentable titles (i.e. it does "title casing").  The most
important function here is "capitalize_title".  It is exported by
default.

There is also an optional "scramble_case" function which is designed
to produce a "wEiRD eFFeCt".

Version 1.2 should work on perl 5.6 (there were problems in the tests).

Version 1.1 improves the speed of the main capitalize_title routine.

Version 1.0 was just fixes test cases with international
characters (switching from latin-1 to utf-8, etc).
Version 0.9 primarily provided some documentation revisions,
and the switch to using Module::Build.
